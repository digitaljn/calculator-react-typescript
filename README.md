# Calculator in React and TypeScript
A working calculator in React and TypeScript. https://tuanpham-dev.github.io/calculator-react-typescript/

## History
This is a React Application that was built using Typescript. You've just been added to the team, and noticed there are NO TESTS! Someone was nice enough to add in a Playwright config and example, but it doesn't meet most of our needs. You'll be assigned tasks to complete to start getting automation in place.

## Helpful Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the webserver, and executes the existing Playwright Tests.
